\section*{Exercise 16.1}
\lstinputlisting{problem_16_1.m}
Our endpoints after the fourth iteration of the Golden Section Search were:
	\begin{eqnarray*}
	a = 0.45835 \\
	b = 0.91670 \\
	\end{eqnarray*}
We find that the true max, $\pi/4$, is well between this interval. The estimated positions and values were as follows:
\begin{eqnarray*}
	x_l = 0.63343 \\ f(x_l) = 0.31417 \\
	x_r = 0.74163 \\ f(x_r) = 0.32167 \\
\end{eqnarray*}
These values very accurately approximate the max after only four iterations.

\section*{Exercise 16.2}

The graph made by the fourth interpolating polynomial looks like this:

\end{center}

This code interpolates a function quadratically in the least squares sense
using the endpoints $a$, $b$, and $x$. After interpolation, if the interpolated
polynomial has a maximum value, the first coefficient is negative. If the first
coefficient is not negative, then we can use the Golden Section Search to produce
a "close enough" approximation for a new value of $x$ to be used for our third
interpolation point. After each "successful" polynomial interpolation, the
furtheset point from the polynomial's max will be discarded.

Running this code, we receive values:
\begin{eqnarray*}
	x_m = .48300 \\ f(x_m) = 0.28653
\end{eqnarray*}

This is curiously no closer than the Golden Section Search. Though, after many
iterations, it does converge properly to the actual max value, $\pi/4$.
